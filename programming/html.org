* HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
It's the standard markup language for displaying content on the web.

** Prerequisites
- The ability to read and understand English.

** Elements
HTML documents are made up of elements.
There are exceptions but generally an element is made up of an opening
tag, the content and a closing tag.
A tag is just some text in between angle brackets (=<= =>=).
An opening tag looks like =<tag>= and a closing tag looks like =</tag>=.

A standard element looks like this:
#+begin_src html
<tag>content</tag>
#+end_src
/<tag> and </tag> are not an actual tags, I'm just using them as an
example/

*** Void elements
These are elements that do not have closing tags.
Some examples are:
- =img=: This is for displaying images
  #+begin_src html
  <img src="picture_of_kitty.jpg" alt="Picture of a cute kitten" />
  #+end_src
- =link=: This is for linking CSS files([[css.org][What is CSS?]])
  #+begin_src html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  #+end_src
*** Replaced elements
These are elements whose contents are controlled by an external
resource.
Some examples are:
- =video=: This is for displaying videos
  #+begin_src html
  <video width="640" height="480" controls>
    <source src="funny_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="funny_videok.ogg" type="video/ogg">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video> 
  #+end_src
- =img=: You already know what this does :) 

*** Non-replaced elements
Self-explanatory.

Some examples are:
- =p=: This is used to describe a paragraph
  #+begin_src html
  <p>
    Imagine lots of words here
  </p>
  #+end_src
- =h1=: This is used to describe a level one heading(There's also h2,h3...h6)
  #+begin_src html
  <h1>Level One Heading<h1>
  #+end_src

** A Standard HTML Document
#+begin_src html

If you're on Windows you can use notepad, just make sure to change file
type from .txt to "All Files" or something like that. While you're at it
consider using [[https://linuxmint.com/][a real operating system]].

If you don't understand something, look it up in a search engine or
better yet, look at [[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/][the spec]].

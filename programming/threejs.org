* ThreeJS
[[https://threejs.org][ThreeJS]] is a library that builds on top of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL][WebGL]] to make it easy to get
3D content on a webpage.

* The Basics
There are three main things you need to understand before you begin
working with ThreeJS.
- The Renderer
- The Scene
- The Camera

** The Renderer
This is the thing that does the drawing on the screen.

** The Scene
You can think of this as the environment where your objects will be
rendered.

** Camera
Think of this as the thing that allows you to see the scene.

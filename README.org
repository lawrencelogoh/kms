* Knowledge Management System
This is a way for me to gather all the "knowledge" I acquire from learning.
It's generally free of my personal thoughts and tries to be as "true"
and "evergreen" as possible.
It's mostly written for myself but if you see something incorrect, feel
free to create an issue or submit a pull request.

For my general thoughts check my [[https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/zet][public zettelkasten]] or [[https://lawrencelogoh.com/blog][blog]].

The general structure is as follows:

- topic
  - README.org
  - subtopic.org
  - subtopic2.org

I hope this of some use to you :)
